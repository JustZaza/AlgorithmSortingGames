# AlgorithmSortingGames
 
AlgorithmGames is a simple interactive console-based game designed to help users understand and practice sorting algorithms through hands-on input. Currently, the game features the Selection Sort algorithm. Players are prompted to step through the sorting process manually, reinforcing their understanding of how the algorithm works.

More algorithm games (like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and beyond) will be added soon â€” stay tuned!
